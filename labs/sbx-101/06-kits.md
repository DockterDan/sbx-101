# Step 6 — Standardizing setups with kits

**Goal:** everything so far was ad-hoc — commands you typed, one sandbox at a time. A **kit** packages capability declaratively, so every sandbox on a team starts with the same setup. You'll build a *mixin kit* that ships a Claude Code skill: a 5-point Dockerfile review checklist.


> **Two kinds of kit:** a `mixin` kit *adds* capability (skills, rules, config) to a built-in agent. An `agent` kit *replaces* the agent definition entirely — the built-in `claude` agent is itself an agent kit you can fork. Today: mixin.

## 6.1 Create the kit tree

Anything under the kit's `files/workspace/` gets injected into the workspace at sandbox creation. In **Terminal B**:

```bash terminal-id=b
mkdir -p ~/workshop/kits/docker-review/files/workspace/.claude/skills/docker-review
```

## 6.2 The kit spec

Press **Save** to write `spec.yaml` — this is the kit's identity:

```yaml save-as=kits/docker-review/spec.yaml terminal-id=b
schemaVersion: "1"
kind: mixin
name: docker-review
displayName: Dockerfile review skill
description: Ships a Claude Code skill that reviews Dockerfiles for best practices
```

## 6.3 The skill itself

The skill is a `SKILL.md`: frontmatter saying *when* it applies, then the exact instructions Claude Code follows. Ours forces a strict, reviewable output format — a table, five rows, no prose:

```markdown save-as=kits/docker-review/files/workspace/.claude/skills/docker-review/SKILL.md terminal-id=b
---
name: docker-review
description: Review a Dockerfile for best practices. Use when the user asks to review, audit, or improve a Dockerfile.
---

When reviewing a Dockerfile, output ONLY a Markdown table with exactly the
columns and exactly the five rows below, in this exact order. Do not write
any prose before or after the table.

| # | Aspect | Status | Findings | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Base image | Pass / Warn / Fix | ... | ... |
| 2 | Layer order | Pass / Warn / Fix | ... | ... |
| 3 | Image size | Pass / Warn / Fix | ... | ... |
| 4 | Security | Pass / Warn / Fix | ... | ... |
| 5 | Reproducibility | Pass / Warn / Fix | ... | ... |

Rules:
- Use exactly one of Pass, Warn, or Fix in the Status column.
- Always produce all five rows in the exact order shown.
- Fill Findings with what you actually see in the Dockerfile, not generic advice.
- If Status is Pass, the Recommendation is the word None.
- No commentary outside the table.
```

## 6.4 Validate the kit

Catch spec errors before any sandbox exists. In **Terminal B**:

```bash terminal-id=b
sbx kit validate ~/workshop/kits/docker-review/
```

What you should see:

```output no-run-button no-copy-button
VALID: /Users/me/workshop/kits/docker-review/ (directory)
```

## 6.5 Create a sandbox *with* the kit

Leave `sandbox-alpha` alone (it still has the MCPs) — spin up a fresh one with the kit attached. In **Terminal B**:

```bash terminal-id=b
sbx create --name sandbox-kits --kit ~/workshop/kits/docker-review/ claude ~/workshop/sbx
```

The create output won't announce the kit — it applies silently. Verify it landed by looking in the workspace on the host side, where the kit injected the skill:

```bash terminal-id=b
ls -la ~/workshop/sbx/.claude/skills/docker-review/
```

There's `SKILL.md`, delivered by the kit at creation time — a plain file on disk, reviewable like any other. Attach in **Terminal A**:

```bash terminal-id=a
sbx run --name sandbox-kits
```

And use the skill it was born with:

```prompt terminal-id=a
Review the Dockerfile in research-app/ against best practices and give me a structured assessment.
```

Five rows, exact format, zero prompt engineering at ask-time. The *kit* did the prompt engineering, once, for everyone who ever gets this kit.

## 6.6 Wrap up

Leave the session (`/exit`) and tear the kit sandbox down — the kit itself stays on disk, ready to attach to the next hundred sandboxes:

```bash terminal-id=a
sbx stop sandbox-kits
```

```bash terminal-id=a
sbx rm sandbox-kits
```

Confirm with:

```bash terminal-id=a
y
```

Your ad-hoc setup became a file you can version, review, and hand to a team. One more page closes things out.
